          The original Eruv website was first set up in 2004 for Shabbat Yom Kippur, and lasted for about 7 years.
          The website was not maintained, however, and eventually the domain was allowed to lapse. Now, the only way
          to see the original Maryland Eruv page by viewing it on the <a
          href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050409115413/http://www.umderuv.org/faq.html">Internet Archive</a>.

        A number of groups needed to give their permission for the Eruv project to get done. See below letters of
        approval from the (1) University of Maryland, (2) College Park and (3) Prince George's County.
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact, since the Eruv makes the entire area it contains into a single, private domain, the County Execute
        of Prince George's County even licensed the entire town to the Eruv Committee with respect to carrying on
        Shabbat.
